# Pokemon Type Lookup
Uses PokéAPI to allow users to look up type matchups, specific Pokémon weaknesses, and more! 

## Usage
You can use the search bar to search by a specific Pokémon name (i.e. Pikachu) and see information like that Pokémon's sprite, type or types, its strengths, its weaknesses, the generation the Pokémon was introduced in, what it evolves from, if any, and what it evolves into, if any.
Or you can use the search bar to search by a specific type of Pokémon (i.e. Fire) and see a list of all the Pokémon that share that type, as well as all the damage relations of that type such as what it gives double damage to and from, half damage to and from, and no damage to and from, if any. When searching by type, you can also hover over any Pokémon's name to see info regarding that Pokémon's base stats.
